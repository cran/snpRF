Author: Fortran original by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, R port by Andy Liaw and Matthew 
        Wiener.  Modifications of randomForest v 4.6-7 for SNPs by Greg Jenkins based on a
        method developed by Stacey Winham, Greg Jenkins and Joanna Biernacka.
Description: A modification of Breiman and Cutler's classification random forests modified for SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data (based on randomForest v4.6-7) to prevent X-chromosome SNP variable importance bias compared to autosomal SNPs by simulating the process of X chromosome inactivation. Classification is based on a forest of trees using random subsets of SNPs and other variables as inputs.
